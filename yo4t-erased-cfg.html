Dear Devs. amp#x200B; I bind my map toggle ' \ ', but I have to set it every time I load the game. I've tried to set it manually via the settings.cfg file, but it gets erased when I load the game. Why? only seems to be the ' \ ' key, it saves it if I bind it to say, 'K' key. amp#x200B; Thanks. Hello, I have just erased the config off an 1841 router and put my new config on and now I'm getting loads of these messages, what are they: Router# %Error opening t ftp://255.255.255.255/cisconet.cfg (Timed out) %Error opening. Hello I have been trying without luck for a couple of days to play a WAV file from a plain esp32 using the ADF (no lyra, no additional components), to a bluetooth speaker. I can't get it work. My code is below, and under that is a log of the build and execution. The things I notice most in the log are these lines: W (7806) SPIFFS\_STREAM: No more data, ret:0 W (7896) BT\_APPL: ### UNDERFLOW :: ONLY READ 428 BYTES OUT OF 512 ### Any help would be much appreciated - if anyon. Can someone please help me about this situation ? This code is keep getting erased and because of that i cant see any jobs. I always have to copy paste this cod and add "0" to config. But its even getting erased while im playing. I had recently made some changes for my key bindings but every time I launch the game, the new changes are erased and it goes back to the old bindings I had. I always need to fix it every time I launch DOI and its getting really annoying. What should I do? EDIT - I found a solution, either you’re editing them in game or you have to go to the ‘Properties’ tab by right clicking the config.cfg file for DOI and if theres a check mark where it says ‘Read only’ check hi all, i've encountered my 2911 router config got wiped out after installing PVDM-64 DSP module and a VWIC3-2MFT-T1/E1. when i did a sh inv and sh run i noticed the router hostname went back to Router and saved config gone. is this related \ GameFramework\ Initialize 'ParseParameters' - #2 portal\_knights(release\_1\_4\_x) - version 185995 (master) \ GameFramework\ Initialize 'ProfilingTimer' - #3 \ GameFramework\ Initialize 'Memory' - #4 \ memory\ Allocated 10 MiB memory in 5 blocks: Block: GameFram: 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000000 0 bytes Main Block: GameFram: 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000000 0 bytes Main Block: GameFram: 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000000. New to the forum, so let me know if this needs to be moved or changed. Performed many searches before taking a deep breath and making this post. My problem is that one day I copied a config from a professional player into the mane config file and now it doesn´t dissapear. I thought of two solutions: 1. I went to the CONFIG workshop map and then copied my updated config to the config file and I managed to save it, but when I closed and re-opened cs it would show again the professional player´s config. 2. I erased the file which contains the 730/local/cfg and launched cs. After that I went the automatically generated new config opened. 
I am seeing there are several ways to erase the startup config like erase startup config and erase NVRAM what is the difference? what are the consequences o 39324. Just thought I'd pass along my experience w/ Qubes, which might be helpful for people thinking about the direction it may take. I tried for three weeks to get Qubes working properly on an inherited machine. I thought Qubes was terrific--it was nearly as fast as running on an unecrypted Ubuntu installation. I found it very helpful to have multiple OS's in easy reach and consuming quite minimal resources. And I liked how easy it was to update multiple installations from one template.

Hi, My hardware: - Intel i5 4670k - Gigabyte Z87-HD3 - Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD - ASUS GTX 760 NOTE: This SSD is a new, blank one that I haven't formatted or done anything to. I previously had a 2TB HDD on the same system and had partitioned it to run Windows and Mac OSX. Both those installations are now not working so I have disconnected that HDD. Here are the steps I've taken on my MacBook Air running High Sierra 10.13.1 1) Took a SanDisk Cruzer Force. I belong to a group that provides live racks.

Hi all, Been pulling my hair out over this for a few weeks now. Fuse (ZX Spectrum Core) says it supports using a full keyboard in Retroarch for text adventures et al by setting user 1 and 2 to 'none' and user 3 to 'Sinclair Keyboard'. I have done exactly this, and tried using both a bluetooth keyboard and a wired USB keyboard with no luck. At first the keyboard would just fire off hotkey functions due to the auto binds, which I then erased. Now it only operates as a Retropad as opposed How to reset Live. Live Versions: All; Operating System: All; Resetting Live does the following: If you have a template set, it will be erased.

I've had no issues playing 1.71 or the previous Global Event. However upon first launch of Divison after 1.8 I crash to Desktop at launch. I get the Connecting "username" spinning orange loading screen after the Ubisoft logo. Then it says "OOPS it crashed" I've sent bug reports. I'm sure this will be fixed soon, however has anyone had any luck. I've updated and downgraded my video drivers with clean installs. I've erased my state.cfg Pretty much the title, I accidentaly erased the whole config folder I'm using OpenMW, Tamriel Rebuilt, Skyrim: Home of the Nords, and Province of Cyrodiil. I'm getting over 140 fps in 1080p, with all the settings set to the highest in OpenMW. However, I can't even get past 30 or 35 fps outdoors in Skyrim or Cyrodiil. Even when I dropped my resolution to 800x600 and turned down all the other settings, the fps won't get above 35 ish. Has anyone found any fps fixes for these mods? I'd prefer fixes that don't require additional mods, since I'm playing 
You can achieve the same result with the erase startup-config command: Router1#erase startup-config Erasing the nvram filesystem will remove all files  if the router's configuration is erased and the router is reloaded, it will either need to be reconfigured manually. I've run into a problem with Doom 3 BFG Edition where everytime I try to take a screenshot (F12) I get an error that says "Achievements have been disabled" over and over. This problem looks like it's related to the console, but I don't want to use the console. I added the line "seta com_allowconsole 0" and changed the screenshot key in the default.cfg file (found in the game's base folder), but the error still shows up. I also tried changing the screenshot key to something else in the "D3BFGC.

I'll try to keep the story as short as possible. Basically I've screwed es_systems.cfg and can't find a way to fix it. This all started with following the directions I on github for adding Kodi to the systems carousel of Retropie. That worked fine but it made it to where I had es_systems.cfg in two locations, one on /opt/ and one in /etc/. Any time I would add an emulator, I would have to edit the es-systems.cfg to have the code needed to have the new emulator on the carousel. I didn't. Some Cisco switches these days have an annoying extra feature called express setup. What you may find, sooner or later, is that someone does some cabling in a cabinet which then causes a cable loom or RJ45 plug to rest against the mode button on your switch. All of a sudden, Ableton has been asking me to authorise my copy of Live Suite - ok easy enough, just click the buttons and bingo. But today I got 'This license has no authorizations left' so couldn't proceed. OK so I've emailed Ableton, hope it'll get sorted out tomorrow. But what is this all about? EDIT Thanks for the responses! Ableton responded thusly: gt I recommend that you erase the existing unlock.cfg file. The unlock file stores the authorization information and sometimes
